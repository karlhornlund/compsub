# Automated Competition Submitter

The goal of this project was to build a tool to automate submissions to competitions posted
on ozbargain.com.au. I've discontinued development of this tool.

I made use of a library called WatiN, which initially looked promising as a powerful API
to access HTML elements - however, the lack of documentation became prohibitive.

There are some promising alternatives in other languages, namely:
	Beautiful Soup [python] : https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
	Puppeteer [javascript] : https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer
